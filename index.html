                <li><strong>1960 </strong>- Yani and Nasution procrastinated when ordered by Sukarno on 31 May 1965 to prepare a plan to arm the people, and rejecting the formation of the country's fifth generation from G30S/PKI</li>

On the same day, Yani and his colleagues were officially declared Heroes of the Revolution by Presidential Decree No. 111/KOTI/1965 and were posthumously promoted from Lieutenant General to 4th general star (Indonesian: General Posthumous)</li>
